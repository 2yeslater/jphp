PHP Compiler for JVM
====================

### Are you seriously?

Yes, we know about another implementation of PHP for JVM: http://quercus.caucho.com/,
but this project is experemental and maybe something will come from this. 

I already implemented compilers and parsers for PHP, you can see these here: 
http://code.google.com/p/orionphp/. This was a few years ago and now I decided to
start a new project of implementation for the PHP language.
